# The Statistical Software

--

**R** is the name of the statistical software for Data Days and the Independent Project. 

--

- In the Lab, R  is installed in all computers. Click the R icon on the desktop.

--

- If you plan to use R at home, 
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank" style="font-size:18px;"> click here</a>
to download the correct version for your system.

<h1> Basic Exploration of R - GUI </h1>

--

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. We are going to use a "point-and-click" version of R for data analysis.

--

**START THE R - GUI**

--

> Step 1: Open R. Double click on the R icon in your desktop.

--

> Step 2: In the R  console, type **library(Rcmdr)**. Then, hit ENTER.

---

A new window will open. This is R - GUI  for data analysis. 

```{r comment=NA, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("~/Hunter College Dropbox/Alejandro Falchettore/notes113/charts/Rcmd-fig1.png")

```

---

In the **R SCRIPT** window, type one of the following expressions. Then, select it and click on SUBMIT.


- 2 + 3


- 2 + 3 * 5


- (2 + 3) * 5


- log(5)


- 6^2


- exp(3)


- sin(pi/2)


You can clear the window, by right click and selecting the option.

<h1> Exploring Data in R </h1>

Data tables in R are known as  **DATA FRAMES**. One of many data frames available in the R system is **mtcars**.

--

**OPEN DATA**

In the top menu, click on: 

--

> Step 1: DATA > DATA IN PACKAGES > Read data set from an attached package ...

--

> Step 2: In the box "Enter name of data set", type **mtcars**. Then click OK.

--

> Step 3: Click on **View data set** to display the "mtcars" data table.

---

Answer the following questions about the data frame **mtcars**:

1) How many variable can you identify?

2) How many cars (or observations) were reported?

3) List any numeric (or quantitative) variables?

4) What variables can be considered categorical (or qualitative)? Explain if any?

<h1>  ALEKS Resources </h1>


```{r comment=NA, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

**ALEKS Calculator**


```{r comment=NA, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("~/Hunter College Dropbox/Alejandro Falchettore/notes113/charts/ALEKS_calc.png")

```


---

Below, you find a brief description and use of all functions available in the ALEKS Calculator that you are going to use during this semester.


$\sum x$: Add all numeric data values (total).

- For example,  2 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 13

- In ALEKS: sum(2, 3, 7, 1)

$\sum x^2$: Add the square of all numeric data values.

- For example, $2^2 + 3^2 + 7^2 + 1^2 = 63$

- In ALEKS: sumsq(2, 3, 7, 1)

---


$\bar{X}$: Compute the sample mean. $\bar{X}$ is read as **X-bar**.

- For example, (2 + 3 + 7 + 1)/4 = 3.25

- In ALEKS, mean(2, 3, 7, 1)

- $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum x$


- $\sum x = n \bar{X}$


$S_x$: Compute the sample standard deviation.


- For example, $\sqrt{\frac{(2 - 3.25)^2 + (3 - 3.25)^2 + (7 - 3.25)^2 + (1 - 3.25)^2}{4 - 1}} = 2.6299556397$

- In ALEKS, stdev(2, 3, 7, 1)


- S = $\sqrt{S^2}$


- $S^2$ is known as the *sample* variance.


- By definition, $S^2$ = $\frac{1}{n - 1}\sum(x_i - \bar{X})^2$

---

- $\sum(x_i - \bar{X})^2$ = $(n - 1)S^2$


- There is also the **population variance**, $\sigma^2$. The $\sigma$ is read as **sigma**.


- By definition, $\sigma^2$ = $\frac{1}{n}\sum(x_i - \bar{X})^2$ = $\frac{n - 1}{n}S^2$


- Before using these formulas, check if your data set represents a **sample** or **population**.


**Sort**: Sort numeric data values in ascending order.


- For example, order 2, 3, 7, 1 to 1, 2, 3, 7


---

[],[],...: Add blank spaces to enter data values.


**(**: Open parenthesis. Useful when combining mathematical operations of defining data set.


**)**: Close parenthesis. Useful when combining mathematical operations of defining data set.

$\sqrt{x}$: Compute the square root of a non-negative number.


- For example, $\sqrt{9}$ = 3

**n!**: Compute the factorial of a whole number.

- For example, 5! = 120

- 5! is read as **5 factorial**. 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5

---

**log**: Compute the logarithm in base 10 of a number greater than 0.


- For example, log(3) = 0.47712125472


**ln**: Compute the natural logarithm of a number greater than 0.


- For example, ln(3) = 1.0986122887


$_nP_r$: Compute a permutation. Total number of "ordered" selections of **r** units from **n**.


- For example, $_5P_2$ = $\frac{5!}{(5 - 2)!}$ = 20


$_nC_r$: Compute the combination. Total number of selections of **r** units from **n**. The order is NOT important. The symbol $_nC_r$ is read as "n choose r".


- For example, $_5C_2$ = $\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!}$ = 10


---

$10^x$: Compute 10 to the x power.


- For example, $10^3$ = 1000


$e^x$: Compute e to the x power.


- For example, $e^3$ = 20.085536923

- For example, $P(B_{10},_{0.65} \leq 7)$ = 0.73839260862

- $P(B_{10},_{0.65} \leq 7)$ = p(0) + p(1) + p(2) + .... + p(7)

### Variables in Data Frames

--

In this activity, you are going to work with the data frame **sleep**.

--

In the R Script, type and run **help(sleep)** to display the documentation related to this data frame.

--

*a)* How many variables can you identify in **sleep**?

--

- Three variables

--

*b)* What variables are quantitative (or numeric)?

--

- One variable: *extra*

--

*c)* What variables are categorical (or qualitative)?

--

- Two variables: *group* and *ID*


---


*d)* Identify the type of variables in the data set **chickwts**.

--

- Quantitative: *weight*

--

- Categorical: *feed*

--

**IMPORTANT:**

--

Everything in R is CASE SENSITIVE.

--

Variables in data frames are accessed with the DOLLAR sign. For example, run: *sleep$extra*.

--

The function **class()** returns the type of object in R. For example, run the following:

--

- **class(sleep)**

--

- **class(sleep$ID)**

--

- **class(sleep$extra)**
